      <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To provide personalized course recommendations</li>
        <li>To assist with course scheduling and tracking</li>
        <li>To facilitate social features, including friend connections</li>
        <li>
          To improve the user experience and functionality of the application
        </li>
        <li>To enable integration with Workday if the user opts in</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
      <p>
        All collected data is stored securely in a restricted-access database.
        Access to user data is highly limited and only available to authorized
        app administrators. We implement industry-standard security measures to
        protect your personal information.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell, trade, or share your personal data with third parties.
        Your information is only used within SCU Schedule Helper for the
        purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.
      </p>

      <h2>6. User Control and Consent</h2>
      <p>
        The aforementioned user data is retained our servers for the length of
        time needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy.
        However, users have control over their data and can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Modify or delete specific data (e.g. course history)</li>
        <li>Modify their preferences in the application settings</li>
        <li>Opt in or out of specific tracking features</li>
        <li>
          Delete their entire account and associated data by navigating to the
          profile page in the extension popup, and pressing "Delete My Account"
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Google Calendar Integration</h2>
      <p>
        SCU Schedule Helper provides an optional feature that allows users to
        export their Workday calendar to Google Calendar. This functionality is
        facilitated through a content script that adds an export button within
        Workday.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We do not store any Google Calendar data in our database or servers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Our application only modifies the user's Google Calendar by adding
          events from their Workday calendar.
        </li>
        <li>
          Errors may occur in the process of exporting events, and users
          acknowledge that they use this feature at their own risk.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be
        posted within the application, and continued use of SCU Schedule Helper
        constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
      </p>
