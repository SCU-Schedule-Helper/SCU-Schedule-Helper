These periods lay on the edge of modernity, when the distinctive characteristics of the contemporary world began to form and when major new connections were made between Europe and Africa, the Middle East, East Asia, and the Americas. Study of these periods from many different points of view affords an opportunity to gain valuable perspectives on the ways that premodern people, events, and institutions helped to shape the modern world. Completion of the minor is noted on the student’s transcript, and students receive a certificate acknowledging their accomplishment.",

The program uses national acceptance data and best practices to guide students in preparation, promotes all majors as viable “pre-health” pathways, and dispels misconceptions about “best” majors. Advising is delivered through individual appointments with the University Health Professions Advisor, a dedicated Camino course site with modular resources (e.g., curriculum planning, career exploration, clinical experiences, testing support, application guidance, and professional programming), and a team of 12 Health Professions Peer Advisors who offer one-on-one and drop-in advising, workshops, event support, and a weekly newsletter. The program enrolls around 600 students, leverages partnerships with healthcare providers for experiential learning, maintains communication via surveys and mailing lists, and engages alumni through a LinkedIn group.",

Graduates with a degree in finance pursue careers as corporate financial officers, traders, investment managers, financial analysts, financial planners, investment bankers, stockbrokers, regulators, and other specialties. Corporate finance officers manage the assets and value of corporations. They examine which new products and investments will be profitable, analyze the most cost-effective ways to produce them and determine where to get the money needed to fund new ventures. Personal financial planners and stockbrokers help people make wise investments by selecting good stocks and assembling efficient portfolios. Students in finance also learn how to understand and analyze information from capital markets, engage in mergers and acquisitions, and undertake investments in new ventures, real estate, and international markets.",

Areas of inquiry include the participation of women in social and cultural production; the construction of gender and its role as a constitutive element of social, political, economic, and legal structures; feminist theory; and the development of ideas about femininities, masculinities, and sexualities. Gender is examined as it intersects with class, sexuality, ethnicity, disability, age, nationality, and the like. The Department of Gender and Sexuality Studies provides an integrated, interdisciplinary approach to understanding the social and cultural constructions of gender that shape the experiences of everyone. The curriculum offers a solid foundation in gender and sexuality studies, facilitating graduate study and careers involving gender justice concerns, and preparing students for leadership roles in diverse workplaces and communities.",

Throughout the course we will use feature-length films as starting points for thinking critically about culture, gender, class, race/racism, economics, ideology, family, kinship, and violence. We will also be critically discussing how film and media shape our perceptions and understandings of the complex, global, and highly socially mediated world in which we live. One of the core premises of this course, following Bird and Godwin (2006), is that we cannot simply assume that media “speaks for itself.” Building upon the work of cultural and media anthropologists, and the late Neil Postman, the primary goal of this course is to push students to take a more active, and anthropologically informed, approach to the highly mediated world in which we live.",

This course will look at some modern American receptions of mythical characters/groups originating in ancient Greece and Rome, including Medea and the Amazons. We will focus on how and why these particular figures/groups, who were often viewed as “marginalized” or outsiders in the ancient world, have been embraced and/or reinvented by modern marginalized groups, including, but not limited to, the LGBTQ community; women, both white and of color; and other persons of color.

Early modern artists of the Bengal School of art grappled with the question of how to be modern and Indian in their search for an Indian-ness devoid of Western elements, while post-independence artists of the Progressive Artists Group could freely work with both Western modernism and Indian idioms toward self-expression.

And in doing so, transformed the notion of the artist from that of mere craftsman to superstar.

Coastal cities sprang up under European colonialism, while 20th century capitals of Beijing and Tokyo modernized their respective nations and ascended the global stage by hosting the Olympics. Today's emergence of the \"megapolis\" calls into question the viability of cities even as \"green cities\" promise a sustainable future. From choosing a site to planning, from architecture to sensory experience, cities are where past and present co-exist and collide.",

How has that writing changed over time to reflect the different social and political needs of its historical moment? How has that writing been shaped by different ways of thinking about race? How has race, in turn, been shaped or constructed by that writing? We will explore how these representations respond to and interact with the “majority culture’s” efforts to define race in a different set of terms. We will focus throughout on autobiography as a site where this struggle over definition takes place—where African American writers have reappropriated and revised words and ideas that had been used to exclude them from both American literary history and America itself.",

The United States emerged from the war as the premiere global superpower in terms of combined military, diplomatic, and financial supremacy. However, the United States found itself under increased scrutiny due to its history and maintenance of structural or institutionalized racism. In the midst of military and ideological conflict against the Nazi regime in Germany, and addressing the claims of civil rights and anti-colonial activists, the United States became a composite site of the tensions that defined a democratic society struggling with ongoing racism. This reading seminar explores these tensions, which were exacerbated by the rise of anti-racist perspectives in the anthropological and biological sciences just preceding the war. The assigned readings and discussions engage these phenomena in order to properly explore the significance of “race” in the World War II era. Also listed as HIST 178.",

Students will explore the ways that these stories and images have been represented in various forms of media (particularly film and television), and learn to connect these representations to the politics of carceral expansion prevalent at the time. Throughout this course we will discuss how storytelling, evolving technology, and cultural/artistic movements have been essential for convincing the public to see criminal threats as real and restrictive social control as necessary; at the same time, these have also been key for artists and organizers seeking to challenge the logic of law-and-order politics, reflect the experiences of those most impacted by these politics, or defend their communities from carceral state violence.",

As we examine the sacred texts of Jews, Christians, and Muslims (Hebrew Bible, New Testament, and Quran), and various methods of interpreting them, our focus will remain on what is shared and what characteristically distinguishes between the monotheistic faiths.",

But, what if Jesus was black, non-white Latinx, Amerindian, Asian, or Jewish? And, why is contemporary scholarship still grappling with the idea of Jewish messiah? In order to map the politics of interpretation and presentation, the course seeks to “radicalize” Jesus by (1) exploring his Jewishness in terms of race and ethnicity; (2) critically engaging sources from the New Testament, Apocryphal narratives, Rabbinic literature, and the Quran; (3) interrogation of the racial/racist reconstructions of Western biblical scholarship; and (4) mapping the implications for marginalized ethnic communities and interracial dialogue. Key themes to explore include: race/ethnicity, colonialism and imperialism, the quests for historical Jesus, Hitler’s Third Reich, eugenics, interreligious dialogue, police violence (Ferguson & Baltimore), and the polemic over Jesus’ wife.",

In their quest for human survival and freedom, migrants face religious intolerance, racism, exploitation and exclusion. Drawing from various scriptural, theological, ethical, sociological and anthropological approaches, this course equips students with a constructive pastoral response to the migrant crisis at home and abroad and challenges them to put a human face to the migrant other. Engaging a lecture-seminar format, the course will include films, guest speakers, and a visit to migrant communities, and deportations centers, and the U.S./Mexico border.

Is there a “solution” to the problem of evil? Is our suffering simply meaningless? Can it be understood? Or should it merely be recognized? Most centrally, the question arises: what is the relationship between good, especially God, and evil? Should we hope? Can we? Is hell stronger than heaven? Does fire burn hotter than love? This is a text-driven course, built around “primary sources,” mainly of a historical nature. We’ll explore drama, biblical texts, philosophical writings, theological works, works of literature, film and television, and so on.",

      "description": "The idea that society's members share a \"common good,\" and that it is the responsibility of politics--and, indeed, all members of society--to promote it, is central to many religious and ethical traditions. It is especially central, perhaps, to the Catholic tradition, in which the common good features as a core principle of social ethics. But what does the ideal of the common good mean in highly pluralistic, fragmented, and, increasingly, conflictual societies, such as the contemporary United States? Can a society even be said to have a common good if its members radically disagree on what that common good is? And how is it possible, in practice, to promote the common good in the midst of difference, polarization, and conflict? This course will explore these and other key questions about the common good today, drawing on resources from Christian (and especially Catholic) social ethics and secular moral and political thought. It will also use the common good as a primary lens through which to consider some of the major challenges facing contemporary societies, primarily but not limited to the U.S.",

In this course, we will approach the study of spirit possession from religious studies, anthropology, and film and media studies perspectives. We will read ethnographic case studies on spirit possession in religious traditions including Hinduism, Islam, Santeria, and Afro-and Indo-Caribbean religions. Throughout the course, we will learn to think in comparative and connected ways about possession in South Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean.",

From the 1970s to the 2000s, religion-based forms of healing moved from being considered “alternative” to “integrative” medicine by the medical establishment.

We will trace the remarkable development and diversification of Sufism as it spread through global networks that transcend modern geographical boundaries, leading us to consider devotional practices in contexts as far afield as India, Java, Arabia, North Africa and the Americas. As we shall see, the study of Sufism necessarily involves engagement with diverse set of phenomena from sophisticated philosophical investigations and cosmologies, to shrine-centered devotional practices and a rich tradition of poetry and music. In the final part of the course we will consider the way that Sufis have responded to the challenges posed by modernity.",

Our focus will be the development of feminist political theories, which both influenced and came out of political struggles for equality (especially those dealing with the intersection of gender and race). These theories will provide us with frameworks through which to analyze the pursuit of women’s equality and the way in which this continues to be intertwined with the pursuit of racial justice in the United States. Topics covered include power imbalances and how they shape ethical and legal rights claims, intersectional feminism, justice in the family, workplace discrimination, feminist critiques of group rights arguments, representation and recognition, sexual exploitation, and pornography.",

But while advancements in this technology create new opportunities for what we can do, there is also an ethical dimension to be explored in terms of what we should do. In this course, we will cover the philosophical and ethical issues raised by current and future AI systems. In particular, we will consider the ways in which ethics can help guide the responsible design and development of AI systems such that they ultimately promote human values and conceptions of the good life. To accomplish this, we will engage in critical thinking and analysis of real-world applications of AI in education, the criminal justice system, the workplace, the environment, social media platforms, and more. Questions to be considered include (but are not limited to) the following: Can machines be biased? What kind of explanation are we owed from AI decision-support tools? How do we align the values of AI with our own? Should robots be designed to influence human behavior and make us ‘better people’? Will automation prevent humans from developing a virtuous character and leading a flourishing life?",

      "description": "This course investigates how interpersonal romantic love relationships are subject to the same social and political forces that pervade our lives in other domains. Students will investigate questions such as “What is love?”; “Should our understanding of love be qualified in relation to race, class, sexuality, gender, ability, and their many intersections?”; “What is Black love?”; “Are love and Black love mutually exclusive concepts?” These questions involve not only love, but also justice, marriage, fairness, exploitation, harm & abuse, consent, agency, authenticity, rights (i.e. of adults and children), citizenship, and immigration. Finally, we will also seek to “queer” heteronormative understandings of “Black Love” in America and globally, by unpacking notions of gender and authenticity: namely, we will ask what does it mean to be a “real” Black woman and man, and what defines “real” Black love.",

What does it mean, exactly, to call for the abolition of an institution rather than for reforms? What are the justifications for and critiques of these radical re-imaginings of our socio-political structures? We will also investigate the intersection of abolitionist issues with race, nationality, class, gender, sexual orientation, and disability, among other dimensions of identity. Finally, we will examine ethical theories of abolition democracy and transformative justice: two notions that abolitionists employ when thinking through how to build life-affirming institutions and community-based accountability processes in place of carceral systems.",

This course develops the sociological analysis of gender systems in contemporary American society. In this course, we will critically examine the multiple ways that gender structures the social world in which we live, and the way that race and sexuality interact with gender. We will highlight social practices at multiple levels of analysis, including biological and socialization processes at the individual level. Next, we will explore how gender shapes the interactions between and among women and men, creating and recreating gender. We will then use this multilevel framework to examine the workings of gender in the American workplace and as individuals balance work and family obligations. Finally, we will conclude by considering the possibilities of a degendered or less-gendered society. The central goal throughout the course is to understand how gender roles and attitudes shape social structure, and how gender inequalities are maintained in everyday social situations.",

Through in-depth, discussion-based engagement with case studies of structural racism in interconnected systems of education, health, criminal justice, the law, policing, housing and employment, the seminar considers the critical role of anti-Black racism and white supremacy in entrenching racial inequality and harm at the systems level.

These hashtags indicate how today's activists and scholars have responded to the proliferation of information and communication technologies with digital practices that bring feminist principles into cyberspace. This course explores how users of digital technology facilitate feminist activism, theory, and practice that cuts across social and material divisions. By uncovering how society and technology function together to reproduce and deepen existing intersectional inequalities, this course takes up questions of social identity and inequality to understand how the convergence of technology and feminism complicates and unsettles norms around gender, sexuality, femininity, and masculinity.",

In each of these cases, we focus on specific objects and their context (e.g., tuna in the Pacific Ocean or redwood trees in Northern California), as we analyze human-environment interdependence, and assess the complex causes, consequences, and potential responses to change processes occurring at the local, national, and global scales.

Technology has come to be identified with what is only a particular kind (i.e., information technology), but the concept itself is far broader. Accordingly, this class seeks to study the formative influences and social impacts of technology and techno-culture. Its starting point will be the utopian science of nineteenth-century Paris, which saw the rise of photography, daguerreotypes, automata, panoramas and electrodynamics, amongst other interesting experiments. Such “romantic” technologies were described in terms of spiritual quest and self-expression, often in ways which anticipate contemporary obsessions with social media and technological progress. In order to explore both romantic and present-day understandings of technology and its social implications, we will establish a dialogue between nineteenth-century techno-culture and our current digital age.",

The course focuses on the development of linguistic and bicultural literacies through the analysis and use of the heritage language. In particular, the course provides you with the opportunity to revitalize and/or expand your Spanish language skills in speaking, listening, reading, and writing—inductively learning grammatical and orthographic aspects of particular concern to learners of Spanish as a heritage language.

However, as we will discover in this course, it can contain a subtle yet mordant denunciation of social injustice. This is especially true in societal conditions that preclude an open discussion of institutional abuses, as was the case in the dictatorial and post-dictatorial states of Ibero-America in the second-half of the 20th century. In more recent decades, the detective story can be read as a commentary on the social inequality that characterizes modern society. In this class we will read a selection of short stories from various sub-genres of detective fiction and analyze how each of these texts serves as social critique.",

How did the civil rights struggle gain momentum in the aftermath of World War II? What was the longer history and role of \"Black Nationalism\" and Pan-Africanism in the transnational struggle? What were the connections between the civil rights movement and contemporary independence movements in Africa and Asia? One of the central goals of the course is to show how we can expand our understanding of US history by reaching beyond the interaction between the US government and other nation states to examine political and cultural change.",

As such, we will cover salient issues in immigration discourse over the last century including xenophobia, exclusion laws, deportation policy, and border policing - all of which are pertinent to immigration policy today.

What strains and opportunities does war place upon democratic societies? Does modern patriotism enable or distort the aspirations of free societies? What forces propel individuals to assist or resist modern war making? This course encourages students to think of war as not an activity solely directed by generals and politicians, but rather a social and cultural event that is formed and negotiated by citizens, workers, and parents. This course places the World War I battlefront in the context of British imperial history, and especially examines how four years of fighting shaped Britain’s modern national and civic identity.

It will cover the foreign and domestic policies of Athens through this period, and cover both the problems and the opposition to democracy by non-democratic polities as well as by those opponents of democracy who lived in Athens itself. Although the United States of America is a Republic and not a Democracy in the Athenian mode (which in fact, was the intent of our Republic's founders), the USA in the 21st century is facing comparable opposition both domestically and in the realm of foreign affairs to those which confronted the ancient Athenians. Parallels between the world of the 4th century BCE and the 21st century will not only be noted, they will be emphasized through readings and class discussions. Cross‐listed with CLAS 113.",

This course is designed to examine the development of modern India from the seventeenth to the twenty-first centuries. We will survey the period as a whole by selecting significant events, processes, themes, and transitions that have shaped modern Indian history. What was the impact of the confluence, integration, and conflicts between different cultures and religions? Why and how did Britain expand, conquer, and prosper at the expense of India? How and why did they exit? How did India become the world’s biggest democracy? The class, in effect, will encompass an overview of the political, economic, social, and technological forces as well as the unique and strong personalities, which have contributed to the making and breaking of India. A better comprehension of where we are at present comes from an understanding of the past. In addition to gaining some knowledge of history, the aim of this course is to help students improve their interpretive analyses and critical-thinking skills through reading, writing, and class discussions.",

We will look at how happiness is affected by winning or by losing, as well as why predicting our future happiness (when we choose mates, careers, and material acquisitions) is often flawed.

The main goal of the course will be to find ways to move from the dark to the light, as some of these dark side concepts have a bright side -- they help people understand themselves, their relationships, their workplaces, and their families even better. For dark side topics that do not have a bright side (e.g., stalking) the course will focus on how individuals might support others who have experienced these things.

Public health campaigns can help curtail this shift by promoting knowledge and awareness about preventive behavioral changes. This course provides an overview of public health behavior change campaigns: what they are, how they are used, and how to design one based on sound evidence and theory. To achieve the objectives of this course, students will be exposed to lectures and read articles and chapters on public health, health behavior change theories, and case studies about public health campaigns that address a variety of health behaviors. Using the knowledge gained from these course materials, students will work in groups to design a small-scale public health campaign targeting SCU students that addresses a health issue of their choice. The campaign will be developed through the course of the quarter and groups will be asked to submit smaller assignments along the way to build towards their final product.",

We will discuss the role of artificial intelligence in the intersection of psychology and technology. The class will also have a little nod to philosophy, as many of our emerging tech is contingent on what we perceive as \"reality\".

When using social media, do you act differently if you think no one knows your real identity? These and more questions are what we will address in the communication ethics course.

We will critically examine how characters in global media culture both reflect and challenge the perspectives on disability identified above. We will unpack how ideas of disability as a type of difference intersect with perceptions of racial, ethnic, gender, national, and sexual difference, whether the intellectual inferiority of colonized peoples, and the newly resurgent scientific emphasis on innate biological differences between men and women. Course materials include readings from social theory, media and cultural studies, and historical studies of disability. Additionally, we will read, listen to, view, and analyze a number of media and cultural texts, including film,episodes of animated television series, iconic works of art, musical compositions, and public online forums of communities of self-identified disabled groups.",

Second, the course will analyze the aesthetic appeal of music from different traditions, in terms of the impact of lyrics, melodies, and other elements of songs and compositions. And, third, it will consider how global music reflects and, in turn, shapes politics and power relations, whether in everyday life or in movements for social change and political protests. The course will look at how musical genres from particular areas of the world have traveled and taken on new forms in other parts of the globe, for example, how African rhythms have shaped jazz and rock or how American protest songs of the 60s have been deployed as powerful statements against authoritarianism continents away. We will pay special attention to the impact of internet-related developments on global music, such as the disruption to the industry caused by streaming technologies and platforms like Spotify, new forums now available to musicians, such as YouTube, and direct access to global audiences without traditional channels of distribution. The global musical traditions covered include jazz, Afro-Cuban and Latin music, rock, hip-hop, fusion, Indian film songs, Flamenco, Rai, disco, EDM, and global percussion traditions.

What kinds of tensions—for example, between individual choice and collective obligations, national identity and cosmopolitan aspirations, tradition and modernity—are associated with food-related practices? How do we respond to the competing ethical claims of vegetarianism and meat-eating? Two, we will examine communication about food, closely reading representations of food in different forms of media, including art, cinema, television shows, and graphic novels. And, finally, we will look at food as the site and space of cultural encounters, as a marker of both similarity in difference. Course readings and materials are drawn from a number of disciplinary backgrounds, including cultural studies, sociology, media studies, and food studies, and from a range of media genres. Within this broad framework, students will develop an original thesis related to food and communication and produce a high-quality research paper by the end of the seminar.",

        "description": "Courses in this Pathway will help students engage in the critical study of film and television history, theory, aesthetics, and production. Students will engage in the interdisciplinary study of national cinemas, international film movements, major and minor filmmakers in various traditions, film and media theory, the economic, legal, and political forces governing the film and television industries, and the relationship between film, television, the arts and culture. Students in this pathway may be asked to analyze and reflect on films or television shows already created or create new films or videos as part of this inquiry. Students may also be asked to compare film and television to other art forms such as novels or plays. A main goal of the Cinema Studies Pathway is to deepen the knowledge and understanding of how cinema shapes, and is shaped, by the culture it exists in and emerge not only knowledgeable about cinema and television, but also enriched by contact with history, literature, foreign cultures, philosophy, and theology.",

        "description": "The variety of associated courses in this Pathway reflects the importance of theories of universal human rights and their applications to a multitude of issues involving oppressed and disadvantaged human groups around the globe. Most current debates focus on historical or contemporary cases of discrimination based on racial identity, gender, caste, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation and age, which have produced deep social and economic inequalities, often given rise to violence, and occasionally led to ethnic cleansing and mass murder. At the same time, critics of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 also debate whether its definition of human rights exceeds what individuals can fairly demand from society and the state. Enforcing laws based on a concept of human rights often produces controversy. Laws protecting the rights of minorities, immigrants, and/or refugees can infringe on what rival social groups consider to be their human rights. The definition of who is human, and thus deserving of these rights, also raises complex social, ethical and legal issues. If the unborn child, fertilized egg or even unfertilized egg is legally defined as a rights-bearing human being, how might that legal definition impinge on the rights of women and the general public? Can we even take for granted the universal applicability to other cultural traditions of human rights that were invented in the Enlightenment and expanded in Western thought and practice since then? Must we recognize a cultural bias in our own claims for human rights when we encounter cultures with a different social logic in keeping with their own religious and philosophical understandings? These are only some of the probing questions that any student who embarks on a Pathway on human rights in a global world will encounter.",

American Studies students analyze America's relations with the rest of the world, the construction and deconstruction of American identities, and changing and competing definitions of America, including critiques of the very name \"American Studies\".",

Is it enough to say that these things help us to survive in the world, or do we value these things for reasons that are much more difficult to explain? In this Pathway, we explore a more complex and controversial motivation for human energy, an interest in beauty. It is an interest we do not always embrace, often preferring the less risky concepts of cute or cool. But while Thomas Kinkade and Kenny G might fit right in, Beethoven sonatas and Michelangelo sculptures are difficult to characterize with such perfunctory terms. We encourage students setting off on this Pathway to consider whether there is a realm of the beautiful and, if there is, identify some of its characteristics and manifestations.",

It emphasizes historicizing experiences within categories of race, sex, class, culture, and nation, and explores issues such as orientalism, modernity, hegemony, nationalism, militarism, fundamentalism, and the gendered division of labor.",

        "description": "At some time or another, many perhaps all disciplines have experienced a sea change in thought, when one or more scholars have pushed beyond the limits of the field’s traditional approaches, assumptions, and understandings. Such dramatic, often rapid, changes that result in a shift away from previously accepted ways of thinking about a discipline can provide the opportunity for you to explore how people learn and how we think. In addition, understanding the sometimes wildly different ways knowledge is constructed and evidence interpreted in different disciplines can help you reflect more insightfully on your own education. This pathway includes courses that address ways of thinking within a discipline that are departures from the accepted norms and courses that include the usual ways of knowing and understanding in a discipline.",
