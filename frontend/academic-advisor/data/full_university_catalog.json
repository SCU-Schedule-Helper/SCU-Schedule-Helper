We will also be critically discussing how film and media shape our perceptions and understandings of the complex, global, and highly socially mediated world in which we live.

This course seeks to reassess these notions by considering Italian Renaissance art within the context of early modern globalism. This reexamination likewise mandates a consideration of a broader spectrum of objects, including gemstones, glassware, and textiles. Topics such as the relationship between Michelangelo, Leonardo, and the Ottoman architect Sinan, the collection of Aztec feather paintings by the Medici family, and the influence of Egyptian mosque architecture on Venetian palace design will be examined from an interdisciplinary perspective.",

Nationally renowned business, military, and civic leaders share the experiences and challenges that shaped them, their careers, and major decisions. The goal of having iconic leaders share with honesty and vulnerability is to inspire students to do the same in the course and their lives. Harvard Business School cases allow students to learn from the most critical business and policy decisions of our times. Putting students in the role of decision-maker challenges them to understand the complexity of decision-making and leadership and begins to train them for their careers post-SCU. Leadership Development Teams (LDTs) are small, mentored groups. The goal is for students to explore and share their authentic selves and develop the courage to live authentically in their careers and lives.

In this course, we will study how behavioral economists explain a range of economic phenomena, and how those explanations differ from standard economic ones. The use of experiments to identify behavioral economic phenomena will be emphasized. We will study various ways in which (so-called) irrationality influences people’s judgment and decision-making.

The objective of the course is to offer students an overview of some of the most topical and relevant (from a business and policy perspective) and interesting (from an academic and general interest perspective) topics surrounding intellectual property. The course covers in particular recent events related to intellectual property, such as the debate on vaccine patents, software patents, \"patent wars\", patent litigation involving patent trolls, and standard essential patents. It also introduces students to the economics of other intellectual property rights, including trademarks, copyright, and design rights. The course material varies substantially across topics; it is both theoretical and empirical and cuts across a number of disciplines, most importantly law and economics.",

But calls for abolition are as much about envisioning new worlds as they are about ending various oppressive and unjust institutions. “Abolition,” as Ruth Wilson Gilmore puts it, “is about presence, not absence.” In this course, we will survey different visions of abolition, paying particular attention to clarifying and evaluating the moral arguments made by abolitionists. What does it mean, exactly, to call for the abolition of an institution rather than for reforms? What are the justifications for and critiques of these radical re-imaginings of our socio-political structures? We will also investigate the intersection of abolitionist issues with race, nationality, class, gender, sexual orientation, and disability, among other dimensions of identity. Finally, we will examine ethical theories of abolition democracy and transformative justice: two notions that abolitionists employ when thinking through how to build life-affirming institutions and community-based accountability processes in place of carceral systems.",

In this course, we will critically examine the multiple ways that gender structures the social world in which we live, and the way that race and sexuality interact with gender. We will highlight social practices at multiple levels of analysis, including biological and socialization processes at the individual level. Next, we will explore how gender shapes the interactions between and among women and men, creating and recreating gender. We will then use this multilevel framework to examine the workings of gender in the American workplace and as individuals balance work and family obligations. Finally, we will conclude by considering the possibilities of a degendered or less-gendered society. The central goal throughout the course is to understand how gender roles and attitudes shape social structure, and how gender inequalities are maintained in everyday social situations.",

Structural racism is understood as ‘the accumulation and incorporation of long-standing racialized practices into social and economic structures.’ These patterns of racial discrimination work alongside gendered systems of heteronormativity to reinforce white supremacy and the inequitable distribution of social and economic resources, influencing multiple pathways to health and well-being. Through in-depth, discussion-based engagement with case studies of structural racism in interconnected systems of education, health, criminal justice, the law, policing, housing and employment, the seminar considers the critical role of anti-Black racism and white supremacy in entrenching racial inequality and harm at the systems level. Students will design projects to apply scholarship to critical anti-racist praxis.",

After establishing a framework in transnational feminisms, postcolonial legal studies, and critical race theory, subsequent units will examine topics including the raced and gendered histories of humanitarianism/human rights, gender and national security, gendered violence, and reproductive justice.

However, both stopped short of the most radical realization of the promises of the age of Enlightenment, particularly with regard to slavery and the racial discrimination that went along with it. The slave revolt on Saint-Domingue and the Haitian revolution, by contrast, witnessed the fullest realization of these promises in the form of the only successful slave revolt in human history. The events on Hispaniola took place at the nexus of world historical forces of globalization through commerce, cross-cultural encounter, racial mixing, and the dispersal of radical Enlightenment ideas and their realization in the form of revolution. As a result of the powerful currents of human history that flowed through the region, the Haitian revolution has proved to be an enduring source of both fear and creativity in the history of race relations, slavery, and abolition, and the forging of a new world identity for the descendants of the once enslaved populations of the island.

What forces propel individuals to assist or resist modern war making?

This course places the World War I battlefront in the context of British imperial history, and especially examines how four years of fighting shaped Britain’s modern national and civic identity. Readings and materials cover the significance of the home front in many forms including the propaganda machine, the Irish problem, public school tradition, industrial organization and trade union activity, and the women’s vote campaign. Civic groups organized by peace protesters, conscientious objectors, suffragists, and striking workers will be explored alongside groups such as national service advocates, Empire leagues, Boys Scouts, and civil preparedness organizations.",

As China’s ambitions have grown, some wonder about its impact on Taiwan, the South China Seas, and even internationally. In addition, its posture vis-à-vis Russia and the United States has changed as well. This course will trace China’s global rise to power since the founding of the People’s Republic of China.",

This course will engage theories of Orientalism, identity and difference, and colonialism and postcolonialism.

Technology has come to be identified with what is only a particular kind (i.e., information technology), but the concept itself is far broader. Accordingly, this class seeks to study the formative influences and social impacts of technology and techno-culture. Its starting point will be the utopian science of nineteenth-century Paris, which saw the rise of photography, daguerreotypes, automata, panoramas and electrodynamics, amongst other interesting experiments. Such “romantic” technologies were described in terms of spiritual quest and self-expression, often in ways which anticipate contemporary obsessions with social media and technological progress. In order to explore both romantic and present-day understandings of technology and its social implications, we will establish a dialogue between nineteenth-century techno-culture and our current digital age.",

Though the Constitution of 1917, one of its most important legacies, was one of the first national documents in the world to enshrine both political and socio-economic rights, the Revolution only partially achieved its lofty goals.

How has that writing changed over time to reflect the different social and political needs of its historical moment? How has that writing been shaped by different ways of thinking about race? How has race, in turn, been shaped or constructed by that writing? And how do representations of gender, sexuality and class participate in a literary construction of race? We will explore how these representations respond to and interact with the “majority culture’s” efforts to define race in a different set of terms. We will focus throughout on autobiography as a site where this struggle over definition takes place—where African American writers have reappropriated and revised words and ideas that had been used to exclude them from both American literary history and America itself.

The United States emerged from the war as the premiere global superpower in terms of combined military, diplomatic, and financial supremacy. However, the United States found itself under increased scrutiny due to its history and maintenance of structural or institutionalized racism. In the midst of military and ideological conflict against the Nazi regime in Germany, and addressing the claims of civil rights and anti-colonial activists, the United States became a composite site of the tensions that defined a democratic society struggling with ongoing racism. This reading seminar explores these tensions, which were exacerbated by the rise of anti-racist perspectives in the anthropological and biological sciences just preceding the war. The assigned readings and discussions engage these phenomena in order to properly explore the significance of “race” in the World War II era.",

Patterns of structural racism work alongside gendered systems of heteronormativity to reinforce white supremacy and the inequitable distribution of social and economic resources. Through in-depth, discussion-based engagement with case studies of structural racism in interconnected systems of education, criminal justice, the law, policing and surveillance, health, housing and employment, the seminar will additionally consider the critical role of anti-Black racism, white supremacy, and the construct of the ‘ally’ in entrenching racial inequality and harm at the systems level. The course integrates cross-disciplinary readings and visual and narrative media material from the growing body of work by scholar activists and racial justice movement leaders, as we consider whose meanings and voices are productive of the knowledge and action necessary to dismantle systems of white supremacy and sustain long-standing movements for racial justice.",

But, what if Jesus was black, non-white Latinx, Amerindian, Asian, or Jewish? And, why is contemporary scholarship still grappling with the idea of Jewish messiah? In order to map the politics of interpretation and presentation, the course seeks to “radicalize” Jesus by (1) exploring his Jewishness in terms of race and ethnicity; (2) critically engaging sources from the New Testament, Apocryphal narratives, Rabbinic literature, and the Quran; (3) interrogation of the racial/racist reconstructions of Western biblical scholarship; and (4) mapping the implications for marginalized ethnic communities and interracial dialogue. Key themes to explore include: race/ethnicity, colonialism and imperialism, the quests for historical Jesus, Hitler’s Third Reich, eugenics, interreligious dialogue, police violence (Ferguson & Baltimore), and the polemic over Jesus’ wife.",

Drawing from various scriptural, theological, ethical, sociological and anthropological approaches, this course equips students with a constructive pastoral response to the migrant crisis at home and abroad and challenges them to put a human face to the migrant other.

It is especially central, perhaps, to the Catholic tradition, in which the common good features as a core principle of social ethics. But what does the ideal of the common good mean in highly pluralistic, fragmented, and, increasingly, conflictual societies, such as the contemporary United States? Can a society even be said to have a common good if its members radically disagree on what that common good is? And how is it possible, in practice, to promote the common good in the midst of difference, polarization, and conflict? This course will explore these and other key questions about the common good today, drawing on resources from Christian (and especially Catholic) social ethics and secular moral and political thought. It will also use the common good as a primary lens through which to consider some of the major challenges facing contemporary societies, primarily but not limited to the U.S.",

We will trace the remarkable development and diversification of Sufism as it spread through global networks that transcend modern geographical boundaries, leading us to consider devotional practices in contexts as far afield as India, Java, Arabia, North Africa and the Americas. As we shall see, the study of Sufism necessarily involves engagement with diverse set of phenomena from sophisticated philosophical investigations and cosmologies, to shrine-centered devotional practices and a rich tradition of poetry and music.

To accomplish this, we will engage in critical thinking and analysis of real-world applications of AI in education, the criminal justice system, the workplace, the environment, social media platforms, and more. Questions to be considered include (but are not limited to) the following: Can machines be biased? What kind of explanation are we owed from AI decision-support tools? How do we align the values of AI with our own? Should robots be designed to influence human behavior and make us ‘better people’?

In this course, we will explore the relationship between communication and time in our interactions, cultures, and societal structures. We will focus on chronemics–the role of time in nonverbal communication–as well as how we talk about time. We will examine time’s effects on communication in relationships, the role of temporality in the workplace, and the many ways in which time exerts agency on our lives. Students will explore their own conceptions of time in a variety of formats.",

The course will explore ways that dark and destructive communication can have detrimental effects on relationships. Exploration into the dark side will include topics such as jealousy, obsessive relational intrusion (stalking), infidelity, stress, burnout, unrequited love, social pain, exclusion, harassment, incivility, bullying, deception, and deceptive affection. The main goal of the course will be to find ways to move from the dark to the light, as some of these dark side concepts have a bright side -- they help people understand themselves, their relationships, their workplaces, and their families even better. For dark side topics that do not have a bright side (e.g., stalking) the course will focus on how individuals might support others who have experienced these things. The course will also evaluate how these dark side topics have disproportionate effects on members of BIPOC, LGBTQIA+, and other marginalized communities.",

We live in a film culture that encourages us to think of fiction and documentary as distinct forms. Recent world cinema has given birth to a wave of films that resist those categories, that blur those distinctions, and instead explore the productive liminal zone in between. All fiction films, no matter how staged, contain a trace of reality, an element of chance. The inverse is also true: no nonfiction film is ever completely devoid of manipulation. Students will view and analyze works by contemporary filmmakers working in the hybrid space. Assignments will be a combination of written responses to those works and a written treatment for a hybrid film of your own creation.",

We will discuss the role of artificial intelligence in the intersection of psychology and technology. The class will also have a little nod to philosophy, as many of our emerging tech is contingent on what we perceive as 'reality'.

We will critically examine how characters in global media culture both reflect and challenge the perspectives on disability identified above. We will unpack how ideas of disability as a type of difference intersect with perceptions of racial, ethnic, gender, national, and sexual difference, whether the intellectual inferiority of colonized peoples, and the newly resurgent scientific emphasis on innate biological differences between men and women. Course materials include readings from social theory, media and cultural studies, and historical studies of disability. Additionally, we will read, listen to, view, and analyze a number of media and cultural texts, including film, episodes of animated television series, iconic works of art, musical compositions, and public online forums of communities of self-identified disabled groups.",

Second, the course will analyze the aesthetic appeal of music from different traditions, in terms of the impact of lyrics, melodies, and other elements of songs and compositions. And, third, it will consider how global music reflects and, in turn, shapes politics and power relations, whether in everyday life or in movements for social change and political protests. The course will look at how musical genres from particular areas of the world have traveled and taken on new forms in other parts of the globe, for example, how African rhythms have shaped jazz and rock or how American protest songs of the 60s have been deployed as powerful statements against authoritarianism continents away. We will pay special attention to the impact of internet-related developments on global music, such as the disruption to the industry caused by streaming technologies and platforms like Spotify, new forums now available to musicians, such as YouTube, and direct access to global audiences without traditional channels of distribution. The global musical traditions covered include jazz, Afro-Cuban and Latin music, rock, hip-hop, fusion, Indian film songs, Flamenco, Rai, disco, EDM, and global percussion traditions.

What kinds of tensions—for example, between individual choice and collective obligations, national identity and cosmopolitan aspirations, tradition and modernity—are associated with food-related practices? How do we respond to the competing ethical claims of vegetarianism and meat-eating? Two, we will examine communication about food, closely reading representations of food in different forms of media, including art, cinema, television shows, and graphic novels. And, finally, we will look at food as the site and space of cultural encounters, as a marker of both similarity in difference. Course readings and materials are drawn from a number of disciplinary backgrounds, including cultural studies, sociology, media studies, and food studies, and from a range of media genres. Within this broad framework, students will develop an original thesis related to food and communication and produce a high-quality research paper by the end of the seminar.",

Students may discover that the courses lead them on a pathway to vocation: as they become both more informed and more passionate about children, they will be attracted to professional fields that address the needs of children and families, such as teaching, counseling, social work, family law, public health, and pre-med. In sum, students who love children and want to work with them will have the opportunity for more in depth learning about the knowledge and personal commitment that are required for such a vocation.",

Students approach the study of American cultures through such diverse fields as history, literature, religious studies, art, economics, and environmental studies, and might focus on such topics as popular culture and material culture, ethnic studies and gender studies, empire and globalization. American Studies students analyze America's relations with the rest of the world, the construction and deconstruction of American identities, and changing and competing definitions of America (including critiques of the very name “American Studies”). We encourage students to intentionally craft a four-course cluster around a theme or topic of special interest to them. Such intentional focus will also make it easier for students to complete the reflection paper.",

They analyze and reflect on existing films and television shows or create new films or videos, and compare film and television to other art forms such as novels or plays. A main goal is to deepen understanding of how cinema shapes and is shaped by its culture, enriched by contact with history, literature, foreign cultures, philosophy, and theology.",

Is it enough to say that these things help us to survive in the world, or do we value these things for reasons that are much more difficult to explain? In this Pathway, we explore a more complex and controversial motivation for human energy, an interest in beauty. It is an interest we do not always embrace, often preferring the less risky concepts of cute or cool. But while Thomas Kinkade and Kenny G might fit right in, Beethoven sonatas and Michelangelo sculptures are difficult to characterize with such perfunctory terms. We encourage students setting off on this Pathway to consider whether there is a realm of the beautiful and, if there is, identify some of its characteristics and manifestations.",

Students engage with issues of discrimination based on race, gender, caste, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, age, and questions about the scope and enforceability of rights—from the United Nations Declaration to debates over cultural bias and competing social claims. The curriculum probes complex legal, ethical, and social challenges surrounding who qualifies as a rights‐bearing human being and how rights for one group can infringe on those of another.",

The Sustainability Pathway allows students to learn about sustainability from multiple disciplinary perspectives and in interdisciplinary ways, integrating the interconnected ideals of viable ecological integrity, viable economies, and equity and justice through themes such as human connections to the physical and natural world, natural systems function, ethics and values, technological and economic relationships, motivating sustainable behavior, and critical engagement with sustainability issues.",
