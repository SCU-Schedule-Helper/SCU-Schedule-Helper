It is the string that precedes all course codes within that department. Sometimes, the department code is not explicitly listed on the page. For this reason, here is a list of all department codes and their corresponding subjects:
ACTG -> Accounting
AERO -> Aerospace Studies
AMTH -> Applied Mathematics
ANTH -> Anthropology
ARAB -> Arabic
ARTH -> Art History
ARTS -> Studio Art
ASCI -> Arts and Sciences
ASIA -> Valid for the Asian Studies Minor
BIOE -> Bioengineering
BIOL -> Biology
BUSN -> Business
CENG -> Civil, Envr & Sust Engineering
CHEM -> Chemistry
CHIN -> Chinese
CHST -> Child Studies
CLAS -> Classics
COMM -> Communication
PSSE -> Posse Scholar
CSCI -> Computer Science
CSEN -> Computer Science and Engineering
DANC -> Dance
ECEN -> Electrical and Computer Engineering
ECON -> Economics
ELSJ -> Experiential Learning for Social Justice
ENGL -> English
ENGR -> Engineering
ENVS -> Environ Studies & Sciences
ETHN -> Ethnic Studies
FNCE -> Finance
FREN -> French & Francophone Studies
GERM -> German Studies
GERO -> Valid for the Gerontology minor
HIST -> History
HNRS -> Honors Program
INTL -> Valid for the international studies minor
ITAL -> Italian Studies
JAPN -> Japanese Studies
LEAD -> Lead Scholars Program
MATH -> Mathematics
MECH -> Mechanical Engineering
MGMT -> Management
MILS -> Military Science
MKTG -> Marketing
MUSC -> Music

SPAN -> Spanish Studies
TESP -> Theology Ethics & Spirituality
THTR -> Theatre
UGST -> Undergraduate Studies
UNIV -> University Programs
WGST -> Women's and Gender Studies

Note that some minors do not have a department, and the department code should be left blank. These types of minors only exist if the page is a non-department page (i.e., the header of the page doesnâ€™t say 'Department of ...'). Instead, these minors come from smaller programs that have one or more directors/advisors, but not an entire department with professors.
